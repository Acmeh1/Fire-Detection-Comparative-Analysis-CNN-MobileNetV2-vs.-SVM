# Fire Detection Comparative Analysis

This repository contains a comparative analysis of fire detection methods using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) MobileNetV2 and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project leverages the [Fire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset) from Kaggle.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle, and you can download it using the provided link. It includes a collection of images, each labeled as containing fire or not.

## Code

The project includes Jupyter Notebook files where you can find the code used for training and evaluating both CNN MobileNetV2 and SVM models. The code is intended for educational purposes and provides a hands-on example of fire detection using machine learning techniques.

## Models

In the 'models' directory, you can find the pre-trained model files for both CNN MobileNetV2 and the trained SVM model.

## Results

The results of the comparative analysis, including accuracy and training performance, are documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Your contributions are welcome to enhance our understanding of fire detection techniques.
